headline: Full Stack Developer Specialiaing in finding ways to get sent to Bel-Air
summary: >
  In West Philidelphia born and raised,
  On the playground was where I spent most of my days.
  Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool,
  And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school,
  When a couple of guys who were up to no good
  Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood.
  I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
  She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."
